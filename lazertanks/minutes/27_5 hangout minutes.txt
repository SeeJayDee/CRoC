Tank Design Meeting 27/5

Issues raised w.r.t. Arduino Mega or Micro. --- 
Mega: more memory, more I/O ports
Micro MUCH smaller footprint
Query ESP8266

Asked about treads: "Zumo" ones would be preferred if larger ones available

Motors fit for purpose

Laser pointer shouldn't be a safety issue - use pwm to reduce power if necessary

Do we want to raise/lower barrel?
Yes, but difficult to implement.

*** FRONTIER ROBOTICS willing to sponsor some parts (tbc) & 3D-printing services ***

Batteries: confirmed LiPo
?? brand/size ??
"2S" - maybe?
regulators probably not necessary
Switchmode converter for power!!!
